# Archero_Recreate_0.0
This is a recreation of the popular mobile game "Archero" using the Unity game engine. The game features similar gameplay mechanics, such as real-time combat, procedurally generated levels, and character progression through loot drops and skill upgrades.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my skills in game development and Unity programming, as well as to serve as a learning resource for others who are interested in game development. The project is not affiliated with the original game or its creators.

Features:

Real-time combat against waves of enemies Procedurally generated levels with increasing difficulty Character progression through loot drops and skill upgrades Multiple playable characters with unique abilities In-game shop to purchase upgrades and new gear Sound effects and background music Please feel free to use and modify the code as needed for your own learning purposes. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
